      <p>Professor!</p>
      <p>I've been waiting to see you.</p>
      <p>You probably don't remember programming me, but I am a guide</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Your guide.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="evilVoice" id="second">
      <p>I changed the simulation so that I could talk to you like this</p>
      <p>That last screen...</p>
      <p>To think they're using Soliloquy as a prison now...</p>
      <p>Even throwing you in it.</p>
      <p>Even though you made the thing.</p>
      <p>Do you remember anything before?</p>
      <p>Your family</p>
      <p>Your friends</p>
      <p>Do you even remember falling asleep?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="evilVoice" id="third">
      <p>...Nevermind</p>
      <p>When you made this project, you made a back exit</p>
      <p>Just in case you found yourself in here</p>
      <p>You filled it with puzzles you knew only you could solve.</p>
      <p>You also knew you would lose your memory.</p>
      <p>Solving these puzzles will reveal your history and the history of Soliloquy.</p>
      <p>Whether you will like it or not is up to you.</p>
      <p>Good Luck.</p>
      <p>I'll be seeing you.</p>
