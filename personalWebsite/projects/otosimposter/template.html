						<h3 class = "subheading2">Background</h3>
						<p>Currently, only 5% of graduating medical students claim that they are comfortable performing eye and ear exams.
							Over 50% of cases of acute otitis media are misdiagnosed and the patient is given a treatment they do not need [1].
							This results in millions of dollars of wasted resources. The fault lies in the training the medical students receive.
							Most of the time, they are shown a static image of the ear or eye, with various pathologies and conditions.
							However, a flat image on a powerpoint slide is very different from looking into an eye or ear through a scope.

						<h3 class = "subheading2">Objective</h3>
						<p>OtoSim exists to bridge the gap between training and real world practice by better simulating the conditions of a real eye or ear exam. By improving the fidelity of medical training, graduating medical students will be more confident in their examinations, producing better results and fewer waste of resources. </p>

							<div class = "block">
								<h3 class = "subheading2">Methodology</h3>

								<p>In order to provide a more realistic rendering of the eye and ear, a few things had to be emphasized:

								The images must be seen through an otoscope of ophthalmoscope in order to simulate what you would see in practice.
								The images must be accurate, taken from real patients so that the images realistically represent a variety of pathologies.
								The images should be animated, in order to simulate a real world scenario where things move around and the patient does not sit still.

								The best way to achieve these three goals was a simulation system using a phone.

						<h3 class = "subheading2">Next Steps</h3>
						<p>There was a study [3] done in 2009 that showed that training using OtoSim improved medical students’ ability to diagnose conditions related to the ear more so than traditional methods. OphthoSim and the new OtoSim Mobile should also be tested to see if they are more effective than traditional methods.</p>

						<p>By creating a more realistic practice environment, medical students will be able to prepare themselves more thoroughly for otological exams in the real world.

I’m sure most, if not all of you have been to a checkup where the physician looked into your ear with an otoscope. Maybe some of you were unlucky to have been diagnosed with acute otitis media, which is a common ear infection. However there is about a 50% chance that you were misdiagnosed and given a treatment that you didn’t need. Yearly, more than 5 billion dollars go into acute otitis media treatment. Imagine if we could cut that number in half by detecting acute otitis media more accurately and giving the treatment only when needed. That’s a lot of money saved, and only for one specific condition.
The problem with the misdiagnoses isn’t that the infection is hard to spot. The physicians are simply not trained well enough, and to no fault of their own.
Here’s the current problem. Look at this picture of the ear. It’s the eardrum. When I show it to you like this, it’s easy to identify the anatomy and diagnose conditions. However, I want you to do this with your hands. <do the action>
Now look at the picture through the hole you just made. Not so easy now, huh? That’s the picture physicians get through an otoscope, vs what they are trained to see in medical school.
There have been attempts to remedy this with everything from physical models to exercises with a real patient, but so far there hasn’t been anything that has proved to be effective.
This summer, I’ve been working with Dr. Forte and Dr. Campisi on creating a mobile simulation system that can accurately simulate what it is like to inspect the ear. It’s called OtoSim, and it works like this: You can mount a physical wax model of an ear onto your phone, and the phone will display real images from real patient’s ears for you to inspect with a model otoscope. The device comes complete with a library of ear-related images and quizzes that will develop the user’s otoscopy skills.
If the research goes well, it will contribute to the decreased wastage of resources and increased knowledge of otoscopy.
