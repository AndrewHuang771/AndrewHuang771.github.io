  <p class = "writingText">They say the clouds are made in a far-off factory beyond the horizon. The name of the man who makes them is Archibald. He’s a short plump man, with a bald patch on his head that gleams like an icy mountain top. The workshop is beautiful, full of small silver instruments that chug along blowing out white vapour and steam. The walls and floor are all glass and the only roof is the sky. During the day, sunbeams pierce through the building and illuminate the sea below and the shadows ripple and dance on the waves. At night, the lanterns are lighted, and the walls glow with their own soft light. Stargazers often assume that the workshop is a comet or a star, but the children remember Archibald’s tale and stare at the horizon, wide-eyed with wonder, trying to spot old Archibald pacing to and fro under the moonlight.

Archibald was, and is, a wizard, one of the last of his kind. Back in his younger days, he was handsome and tall. Wizards were not at all what people nowadays remember them to be. They didn’t wear pointy hats, they didn’t carry around crystal balls, and they definitely did not use wands. In fact, a wizard would now be called an engineer, albeit one that used magic in his creations. Archibald made many great things: flags that flew without wind, lamps that shone in the darkest sea, and self-cleaning aqueducts that brought drinking water to the city. All the wizards lived in a great city, surrounded by a beautiful wall a kilometer high. The streets were made from cobblestone and were used by horses, donkeys and, of course, people. Carts would return loaded with ash wood from the nearby forest, which the lumberjacks (who were also witches and wizards) would craft into delightful houses. At night, the city would be lit up with multicolored lights, and the astronomers would observe the skies above in hopes of finding some new star or yet undiscovered planet. The harvests were plentiful, the land was rich, and the people were happy. Archibald in particular was very happy; he was engaged to a beautiful young witch named Lucy. They were to be married the next month. However, that day never came.

Four days before the wedding, Archibald was working on his latest creation, his most ambitious one yet, when something went horribly, horribly wrong. He had been trying to find a way to bring water to the town without the need of aqueducts. He decided on an airborne carrier that could soak up water from the oceans and drop it on the town. He called it the “cloud”. His initial experiments were promising, but now he was stumbling blindly through a thick black mist. He groped at the walls of his underground workshop, but couldn’t find the lever to close the airlock. Slowly, the smog escaped the room, passing upwards through every crack and crevice. Aboveground, it was nighttime, and no one could see the dark cloud against the night sky. No alarm was raised, and no wizards rose to stop the cloud. Helpless, Archibald could only look on as the stars disappeared one by one, covered by his errant creation. Day never came; the cloud blocked out even the Sun. The King summoned all his magicians. Many people, even some wizards, thought it was the end of the world. Archibald, overcome with guilt, confessed his mistake. He was charged to get rid of the cloud, whereupon regardless of success or failure, he would be exiled.

Archibald worked a long time down in his workshop. He lost his hair, his stature, and his muscle. After seven days and seven nights of nonstop work, he emerged from his den. In his scorched hand he clutched a phial of pure air, as pristine as a breath of wind from the northern mountains. He released it into the air, and the dark cloud dissipated. The townspeople rejoiced, but the King, true to his word, exiled poor Archibald. Lucy begged him to take her with him, but he knew he couldn’t condemn his beloved to a life of suffering or a marriage to what was now a broken man. He left the city by night, heartbroken and dejected.

He wandered aimlessly for a long time, taking jobs when he could get them, his fame forgotten and his old life a bitter memory. He could never settle; no city was beautiful enough and no one could ever replace Lucy. Eventually, at the end of his wanderings, he found himself at the Edge of the World. There, he set up a new workshop and made it fly with his magic. Over the years, he perfected his craft, sculpting beautiful, elegant clouds. But his heart still longed for Lucy and the city. He kept making clouds, hoping that they would find their way back to the town where Lucy would be waiting. He imagined one fateful day she would look up and see the heavens lit by the colors of dawn reflected by a thousand clouds. He dreamed that particular dream a lot. Strange things happen at the Edge of the World, and Archibald remains while the rest of the world passes on.

Though now Lucy and the city are long gone, Archibald still sends out his clouds. If you think you’ve ever seen shapes in the clouds or found messages in the reds and oranges of dusk, remember Archibald and his story, and look for his workshop just over the horizon, gleaming like a star beneath the light of the falling Sun.
